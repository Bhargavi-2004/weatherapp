Integration using src in script is a way to include external JavaScript code into an HTML document. This is done by using the <script> tag with the src attribute. The value of the src attribute should be the URL of the external JavaScript file.


Integration using src in script has a number of advantages:

It allows you to reuse the same JavaScript code on multiple pages.
It makes your code more modular and easier to maintain.
It can improve the performance of your web pages by loading the JavaScript code in parallel with the HTML code.
